### Submissions

#### Danil Khromov
##### Title:
Transient Impressions
##### Description:
Used envelopes are repurposed as canvas for photo prints to juxtapose disposability of photography on social media with the tangible quality of physical mail. Each envelope represents a captured moment, frozen in time while also serving as a reminder of the fleeting attention that art often receives in the vast landscape of online social media platforms.

The deliberate choice of repurposing discarded envelopes as the backdrop for the photo prints symbolizes the transience and impermanence of artistic expression in the digital realm. It challenges the viewer to reflect on the constant influx of images in our lives, rapidly consumed and forgotten. By reclaiming these envelopes and infusing them with visual narratives, the artwork aims to question the impact of the ever-evolving social media culture on our perception and appreciation of art.

##### Title:
The Yellow Dragon
##### Description:
In this photograph, we are transported to Bangkok, Chinatown, during the Chinese New Year festivities. This image captures a mesmerizing scene where the celebration of the new lunar year unfolds in a symphony of colours, traditions, and collective joy.
The photograph's focal point is a majestic yellow dragon, held aloft by a group of individuals dressed in traditional attire. The dragon's sinuous body, intricately crafted and adorned, symbolizes prosperity, power, and good fortune. As the dragon writhes through the streets, its every move is accompanied by the beat of drums and explosions of fireworks erupting from its mouth, painting the night sky in a kaleidoscope of brilliant colour.
People gather around, their faces alive with excitement and anticipation. The air is filled with the sounds of laughter, traditional music, and the crackle of firecrackers, evoking a sense of wonder and delight.

This photograph encapsulates the essence of celebration, unity, and the joyous spirit that permeates festive occasions. It illustrates the harmonious blend of cultural traditions and the power of collective participation in creating shared experiences. As we gaze upon this image, we are reminded of the interconnectedness of humanity and the universality of the human desire to come together in celebration.

This photograph showcases how our diverse cultural celebrations provide a playground for expressing our shared humanity. It reminds us that regardless of our individual backgrounds and traditions, we all possess an innate capacity for celebration, curiosity, and the unifying experience of joy. It invites us to embrace the spirit of celebration in our own lives, fostering a sense of playfulness, wonder, and reverence for the richness of cultural diversity that exists within our global playground.

##### Title:
Unmasked
##### Description:
I’m in a state of delirium, somewhere between pure joy and obsession. I haven’t slept much these last few days. My head is buzzing and I’m close to complete exhaustion. I don’t accept the limits of my body right now. I keep pushing. “Don’t forget to take care of yourself”, you often say. I barely listen.

“What do you want to express? What’s the message you want to convey?”
Antoine asks me again, gently. He is probing. He has to.
I don’t know what to say. And smile it off.
But I know he is hitting a nerve.

Social masking is defined as the process in which a person hides parts of themselves in plain sight. Often adopted subconsciously, it aims to present a version of oneself that fits in while suppressing what is perceived as socially or culturally inappropriate, against the norm, or “wrong”.

The authentic self, one's wishes and needs, thoughts, or emotions are often disguised in an attempt to feel loved and accepted.

A danse macabre of secrets in step.
A whirling and spinning of concealed selves with carefully constructed stories.
At times, aren’t we all playing a role?

Roleplay…
“Be good. Just adapt, … shapeshift!”

What happens if we reveal ourselves?

And dive into a realm
far underneath the flesh
To create spaces where perception is malleable and boundaries dissolve,where new connections are free to emerge,curiosity and wonder.

What happens if we reveal ourselves?

Selection of works produced in mentoring workshop with Antoine D’Agata, Berlin April/May 2023.

##### Title:
Urban Playgrounds
##### Description:
Most of the time we want what we can't have. Children want to play where they shouldn't. They build their own creative urban playgrounds in places that are prohibited or dangerous. It goes from playing football in areas where they are too loud and could break windows or even underground subway stations. They try to touch driving trains with their hands and like the way their fingers get black from the dirt on the train.

In our society children should only play in places that are designed for them: official Playgrounds, football pitches or where they don't annoy adults with their loud noises and creativity.

But kids don't want to be restricted in their games. They want to be rebelious, get dirty ,be loud and play wherever it's forbidden.

##### Description:
When I think of a play, I see an action, entertainment, performance, happening. My first connotation is children- young people. I now have the pleasure of accompanying as an uncle two girls growing up. Thanks to them, I am reacquainting myself with games that, from a contemporary perspective, I see critically and relate to my experience.

I have noticed that gender gives them a whole spectrum of play- it is performed (mostly felinity in their particular case). It's also pa kind of a joke, because they don't feel they are women yet, but they act it out-they put lipstick on themselves, they wash their clothes. Being a woman, in this case, seems to be a status to which one must first grow up and earn it for oneself.

As an adult, I have a fairly constructed vision of gender. My nieces allow me to look at gender as something fluid, as a playing field.

#### Evgeniy Kazannik
##### Description:
Evgeniy Kazannik is a visual artist working predominately with analogue printing techniques. He studied photography at the London College of Communication (University of the Arts London) and worked as a commercial photographer for over 15 years, with work published in the Guardian, FT, Wire, Wax Poetics, NME, XLR8R and others. He moved away from working with traditional camera techniques in 2019 and started developing a new analogue process instrumenting Lumen Printing and Photogram among others.

Utilizing elements of analogue printing, collage, and tape, Kazannik's artistic works inhabit a space that intersects early photograms and constructivist art, occasionally drawing inspiration from orthodox iconography. Displaying a playful sensibility, his creations explore the boundaries of these art forms, pushing the limits of experimentation and expression.

#### Andreas Stueckl
##### Title:
Stardust
##### Description:
I have delved deep into the mystical connection between chemical reactions and photographic paper, and from the abyssal void of pitch-black overexposure, I witness the emergence of new life, new dimensions,new galaxies, each a unique creation beyond replication. This alchemical process culminates in a hybrid form of art, for the worlds I conceive are mere square centimeters in size. To amplify their enigmatic aura, I digitize these microcosms and magnify them to unlock their full, abstract potential.

The reference to the theme "Playground" is quite clear, as I use various chemical cocktails to bring a black-developed photographic paper back to life. The photo paper itself is my "playground“.
