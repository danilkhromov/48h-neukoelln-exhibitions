### Submissions

#### Danil Khromov
##### Title:
Transient Impressions
##### Description:
Used envelopes are repurposed as canvas for photo prints to juxtapose disposability of photography on social media with the tangible quality of physical mail. Each envelope represents a captured moment, frozen in time while also serving as a reminder of the fleeting attention that art often receives in the vast landscape of online social media platforms.

The deliberate choice of repurposing discarded envelopes as the backdrop for the photo prints symbolizes the transience and impermanence of artistic expression in the digital realm. It challenges the viewer to reflect on the constant influx of images in our lives, rapidly consumed and forgotten. By reclaiming these envelopes and infusing them with visual narratives, the artwork aims to question the impact of the ever-evolving social media culture on our perception and appreciation of art.

##### Title:
The Yellow Dragon
##### Description:
In this photograph, we are transported to Bangkok, Chinatown, during the Chinese New Year festivities. This image captures a mesmerizing scene where the celebration of the new lunar year unfolds in a symphony of colours, traditions, and collective joy.
The photograph's focal point is a majestic yellow dragon, held aloft by a group of individuals dressed in traditional attire. The dragon's sinuous body, intricately crafted and adorned, symbolizes prosperity, power, and good fortune. As the dragon writhes through the streets, its every move is accompanied by the beat of drums and explosions of fireworks erupting from its mouth, painting the night sky in a kaleidoscope of brilliant colour.
People gather around, their faces alive with excitement and anticipation. The air is filled with the sounds of laughter, traditional music, and the crackle of firecrackers, evoking a sense of wonder and delight.

This photograph encapsulates the essence of celebration, unity, and the joyous spirit that permeates festive occasions. It illustrates the harmonious blend of cultural traditions and the power of collective participation in creating shared experiences. As we gaze upon this image, we are reminded of the interconnectedness of humanity and the universality of the human desire to come together in celebration.

This photograph showcases how our diverse cultural celebrations provide a playground for expressing our shared humanity. It reminds us that regardless of our individual backgrounds and traditions, we all possess an innate capacity for celebration, curiosity, and the unifying experience of joy. It invites us to embrace the spirit of celebration in our own lives, fostering a sense of playfulness, wonder, and reverence for the richness of cultural diversity that exists within our global playground.

##### Title:
Unmasked
##### Description:
I’m in a state of delirium, somewhere between pure joy and obsession. I haven’t slept much these last few days. My head is buzzing and I’m close to complete exhaustion. I don’t accept the limits of my body right now. I keep pushing. “Don’t forget to take care of yourself”, you often say. I barely listen.

“What do you want to express? What’s the message you want to convey?”
Antoine asks me again, gently. He is probing. He has to.
I don’t know what to say. And smile it off.
But I know he is hitting a nerve.

Social masking is defined as the process in which a person hides parts of themselves in plain sight. Often adopted subconsciously, it aims to present a version of oneself that fits in while suppressing what is perceived as socially or culturally inappropriate, against the norm, or “wrong”.

The authentic self, one's wishes and needs, thoughts, or emotions are often disguised in an attempt to feel loved and accepted.

A danse macabre of secrets in step.
A whirling and spinning of concealed selves with carefully constructed stories.
At times, aren’t we all playing a role?

Roleplay…
“Be good. Just adapt, … shapeshift!”

What happens if we reveal ourselves?

And dive into a realm
far underneath the flesh
To create spaces where perception is malleable and boundaries dissolve,where new connections are free to emerge,curiosity and wonder.

What happens if we reveal ourselves?

Selection of works produced in mentoring workshop with Antoine D’Agata, Berlin April/May 2023.
