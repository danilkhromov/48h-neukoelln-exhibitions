### Submissions

#### Danil Khromov
##### Title:
Transient Impressions
##### Description:
Used envelopes are repurposed as canvas for photo prints to juxtapose disposability of photography on social media with the tangible quality of physical mail. Each envelope represents a captured moment, frozen in time while also serving as a reminder of the fleeting attention that art often receives in the vast landscape of online social media platforms.

The deliberate choice of repurposing discarded envelopes as the backdrop for the photo prints symbolizes the transience and impermanence of artistic expression in the digital realm. It challenges the viewer to reflect on the constant influx of images in our lives, rapidly consumed and forgotten. By reclaiming these envelopes and infusing them with visual narratives, the artwork aims to question the impact of the ever-evolving social media culture on our perception and appreciation of art.
